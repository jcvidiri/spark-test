Computer files can be divided into two broad categories: binary and text. The distinction is vague because in many contexts, any file is a sequence of digital bits. For instance, to the circuits which handle information read from or written to a disk, there is no distinction between text data and any other sort. The software concerned with those circuits likewise makes no such distinction. Humans, on the other hand, are concerned with this distinction.

Text files (plain text files) are files with generally a one-to-one correspondence between the bytes and ordinary readable characters such as letters and digits. Therefore any simple program to view a file makes them human-readable. Generally, they contain ASCII characters and some control characters such as tabs, line feeds and carriage returns without any embedded information such as font information, hyperlinks or inline images. But sometimes text files contain more than ASCII characters if they are encoded by East-Asian encoding such as SJIS or Unicode. If the files are written in Unicode, a UTF standard such as UTF-8 defines the encoding format. Although text files are generally human-readable, they can of course be used for data storage by computer programs. This may be done because text files avoid problems which may arise with binary files, such as problems of endianness or the byte-length of integers.
